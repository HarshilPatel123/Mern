        E-commerce is the buying and selling of goods or services over the internet. It has become an increasingly popular way to shop, as it is convenient and often cheaper than traditional brick-and-mortar stores. E-commerce also offers a wider selection of goods and services than most physical stores. There are several reasons why e-commerce is so popular.
First, it is convenient. Customers can shop at any time of day or night from the comfort of their own homes. They donâ€™t have to deal with traffic, crowds, or weather. Second, e-commerce often offers lower prices than traditional stores because businesses save on overhead costs like rent, utilities, and employees. Finally, customers can usually find a wider selection of goods and services online than they can in a physical store.
E-commerce also offers businesses a more efficient way to manage inventory and orders, and can help them save money on overhead costs. For these reasons, e-commerce is becoming an increasingly popular option for businesses of all sizes.
